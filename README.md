# Benchgl

BenchGL is a WebGL framework for general purpouse web rendering, data visualization and graphic application development.

I wrote it as part as my master thesis in my Computer Science degree.

The project was about investigating the capabalities and performance of a [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) Javascript powered graphics engine for scientific and medical visualisation using a parallelised version of the [Marching Cubes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes).
